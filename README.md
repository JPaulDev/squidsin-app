<h1 align="center">sQuidsIn App</h1>

sQuidsIn is an app that helps friends split bills easily. Users can create an account, add friends,
and then add a new expense and choose which friends they want to split it with. They can also easily see which
friends owe them money and which friends they owe money to. Friends can then settle their share of an expense and it is marked
as paid and the outstanding balance is cleared. This app was the final project which
made up part of the Northcoders bootcamp. Teams were challenged to build something which used new and unfamiliar technologies and were 
required to present the final project to the rest of the cohort upon completion of the bootcamp.
